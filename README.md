- I’m comfortable working directly with clients or stakeholders to understand requirements, suggest improvements, and deliver solutions that meet expectations.
- I’ve also **mentored junior developers**, reviewed code regularly, and contributed to improving team efficiency and coding standards.
- I prefer writing **reusable components**, maintaining consistency across UI, and ensuring smooth handoffs from design to development.
- Used to working in **Agile environments**, I regularly participate in sprint planning, task breakdown, and on-time delivery.
